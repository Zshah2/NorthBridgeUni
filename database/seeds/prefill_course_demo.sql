-- Prefilled course catalog + offerings so Admin → Courses / course detail reads naturally.
-- Prerequisites: migrations applied (through 018+) and core CSV import so users, departments,
-- students, and faculty exist (php scripts/import_all.php).
--
-- Apply with MySQL client:
--   mysql -u USER -p DATABASE < database/seeds/prefill_course_demo.sql
--
-- Or use the PHP seed (recommended; resolves faculty/student IDs safely):
--   php scripts/seed_demo_registration.php
